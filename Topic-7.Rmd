###Theory 7.9.5
```{r}
#A. As lambda approachs infinity, the smoother spline (hat g2) will have the smaller training RSS because it will be more flexible (as it is a higher order polynomial)

#B. As lambda approaches infinity, it is likely that the less smooth spline (hat g1) will have the smaller testing RSS because it will likely overfit the data (too flexible, perhaps).

#C. When lambda is zero, both hat g1 and hat g2 will have the same training and testing RSS because there is no smoothing parameter.

```
###Computing 7.9.11
```{r}
#A. Generate a response Y and two Predictors with X1 and X2, with n = 100.
library(gbm)
y<- rnorm(100)*10
x1<- rnorm(100)*10
x2<-rnorm(100)*10
#B. Initialize beta1 to take on value of choice.
beta1<- 10
#C. Keep beta1 fixed, fit the model
a<- y-beta1 *x1
beta2<- lm(a~x2)$coef [2]
#D. Keep beta2 fixed, fit the model
a<- y-beta2*x2
beta1<-lm(a~x1)$coef[2]
#E. for loop to repead c and d
beta_values<-matrix(NA, nrow = 1000,ncol = 3)
for(i in 1:1000){
  a<- y-beta1*x1
  beta2<-lm(a~x2)$coef[2]
  
  a<-y-beta2*x2
  fit<-lm(a~x1)
  beta1<-fit$coef[2]
  
  beta0<- fit$coef[1]
  
  beta_values[i,1]<- beta0
  beta_values[i,2]<- beta1
  beta_values[i,3]<- beta2
}
#F. multiple linear regression to predict Y using X1 and X2. Usethe abline() function to overlay those multiple linear regressioncoefficient estimates on the plot obtained in (e).

{plot(1:1000,ylim = c(-1,1))
lines(beta_values[,1], col = "red")
lines(beta_values[,2], col = "green")
lines(beta_values[,3], col = "blue")

lm_mod<- lm(y~x1+x2)
coef(lm_mod)
abline(h = lm_mod$coef[1], lty = "dotted", lwd = 3, col = "orange")
abline(h = lm_mod$coef[2], lty = "dotted", lwd = 3, col = "orange")
abline(h = lm_mod$coef[3], lty = "dotted", lwd = 3, col = "orange")}
