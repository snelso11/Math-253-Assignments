# In-Class Programming Activity, Day 17


##Growing and pruning trees
```{r}
Cartoon_data <- data.frame(
x = 1:8,
y = c(2,5,1,3,8,5,4,6),
class = c("A", "B", "A", "A", "B", "B", "A", "B")
)
library(tree)

```

##Perfectly pure trees
```{r}
pure <- tree.control(8, mincut = 0, minsize = 1, mindev = 0)
```
##Regression tree
```{r}
rtree_pure <- tree(y ~ x, data=Cartoon_data, control = pure)
{plot(rtree_pure)
text(rtree_pure)}
#The output for x=3 is 1
```
##Classification tree
```{r}
ctree_pure <- tree(class ~ x, data=Cartoon_data, control = pure)
{plot(ctree_pure)
text(ctree_pure)}
#The output for x=7 is A.
```

##Evaluating the tree
```{r}
predict(rtree_pure)
predict(ctree_pure)
predict(rtree_pure, newdata = data.frame(x = 3))
predict(ctree_pure, newdata = data.frame(x = 7))
```
##Deviance of each node
```{r}
print(rtree_pure)
print(ctree_pure)
#label each split according to deviance
```

##Deviance of a tree
```{r}
sum(predict(ctree_pure))
sum(predict(rtree_pure))
```
##Pruning the tree
```{r}
rtree_5 <- prune.tree(rtree_pure, best = 5)
ctree_2 <- prune.misclass(ctree_pure, best = 2)
nterminal<- 2:8
tree_variance <- deviance(rtree_5, detail = TRUE)
```
##Building a real classifier
```{r}
library(mosaicData)
pure_for_cps <- tree.control(nrow(CPS85), mincut = 0, minsize = 1, mindev = 0)
Sector_classifier <- tree(sector ~ wage + sex + educ + exper,
data = mosaicData::CPS85,
control = pure_for_cps)
classifier_20 <- prune.tree(Sector_classifier, best = 20)
print(classifier_20)
#The deviance of the classifier_20 is 2124. 
{plot(classifier_20)
text(classifier_20)}
```

## Test statements

```{r}
#scoreActivity::score253(17)
